# rust-daily-challanges
Daily Rust coding challenges to improve my problem-solving skills. Each day I solve one problem, write the code in Rust, and push it to this repository.

## How It Works
- Every day, I solve one coding problem.
- Each problem is placed in its own directory (e.g., `day01`, `day02`).
- The solution is implemented in Rust using Cargo.
- I commit and push my solution to this repository daily.

## Repository Structure 
- `day01/`: Contains the solution for the first day's challenge.
  - `src/main.rs`: The main Rust code.
  - `Cargo.toml`: The Cargo configuration file.
- `day02/`: Contains the solution for the second day's challange.
- `...`

## How to Run the code
To run the code for any day:
1. Navigate to the day's directory:
   ```bash
   cd day01
   ```
2. Run the code using Cargo:
   ```bash
   cargo run
   ```
